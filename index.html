                <p>
                        Hi There! My Name is CJ Conrad. I am a programmer just learning the foundations of strong code.
                    I am excited to be buiulding a new identity in this field, but, I didn't always want to coomune with computers.
                </p>


                <p> 
                        My background is in the arts. I chased a dream on stage for many years;
                    singing, dancing, and acting my way into the hearts of people in the PNW. 
                    But, when I took a hard look at the life required
                    to actually pursue a long career in the theatrical arts, I quickly changed my path.
                    Not only was the pay inconsistent, but most full time actors spent much of their years on the road.
                    With the consideration of no time for family, and the need for full devotion of my time, 
                    it became clear to me that acting just wasn't what I was meant to do.
                </p>


                <p>
                        After my epiphany, working three jobs to support my theater habbit seemed aufully unnecessary. 
                    So I started the hunt for a single job that could pay the bills. Having opted out of the typical college route, 
                    I was hunting for a solid gig on a High School Diploma alone.
                    Although, "a High School Diploma alone," might sound a bit under-accomplished, condsider this: As of 2015, 
                    The U.S. Department of Education found that after financial aid is subtracted, 
                    9 out of 10 of the most expensive schools are art institutions.
                    Now take into account that the average annual income for an artist is somewhere around $53,000, according to a simple google search. 
                    <i>That number seems awfully generous...</i>

                </p>


                <p>
                        Most of the top arts schools in the country would easily leave a student with six figures of debt hanging over their heads; 
                    Alongside a degree in being a starving artist. All that debt and an art degree didn't maske any sense to me. So, I skipped that step.
                    When you consider this perspective, it looks like an intelligent move. Intelligence isnt always reflected by wether you attended universtity
                    or not.
                </p>

        
                <p> 
                        My primary goal with the pursuit of a career in Web Design is to win back my time.
                    not only to find more flexibility, but to make my working time more valuable.
                </p>


                <p>
                        I am more than just a programmer. I bring everything that I've learned before with me to this new career path.
                    everywhere I go, wether it is for work or pleasure, I make a difference. Let me bring some value to your workplace, 
                    and make a difference for you too.
